          <h2>15<sup>th</sup> Century</h2>
          <p>According to the Scotch Whisky Association, Scotch whisky evolved from a
             Scottish drink called <i>uisge beatha</i>, which means "water of life".
             The earliest record of distillation in Scotland occurred as long ago as
             1494, as documented in the Exchequer Rolls, which were records of royal
             income and expenditure. The quote above records eight bolls of malt given
             to Friar John Cor wherewith to make aqua vitae (Latin for "water of life,"
             = <i>uisge beatha</i>) over the previous year. This would be enough for
             1,500 bottles, which suggests that distillation was well-established by
             the late 15<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
          <p>Initially, whisky was also consumed as a tonic for medicinal purposes.
            In 1505 the City of Edinburgh awarded the medical practitioners, The Guild
            of Surgeon Barbers, the rights to monopolize whisky in the city.</p>

        <p>Whisky production was first taxed in 1644 by the Scottish Customs & Excise
          (known as <i>Gougers</i>), causing a rise in illicit whisky
          distilling in the country. This drove many distillers to move to rural areas
          such as the glens, highlands and islands to set up illicit stills and avoid
          paying duty on the whisky they produced. In 1690, Ferintosh Distillery became
          the first commercial whisky distillery in Scotland as a result of Duncan Forbes of
          Culloden gaining exemption from paying the whisky duty.</p>
        <p>Between the 1760s and the 1830s a substantial
          unlicensed trade originated from the Highlands, forming a significant part
          of region's export economy. In 1782, more than 1,000 illegal stills were
          seized in the Highlands: these can only have been a fraction of those in
          operation. The Lowland distillers, who had no opportunity to avoid taxation,
          complained that un-taxed Highland whisky made up more than half the market.
          The heavy taxation during the Napoleonic Wars gave the illicit trade a big advantage,
          but their product was also considered better quality, commanding a higher price
          in the Lowlands. This was due to the method of taxation: malt was subject to tax
          (at a rate that climbed substantially between the 1790s and 1822). The licensed
          distillers therefore used more raw grain in an effort to reduce their tax bill.</p>

        <h2>19<sup>th</sup> Century</h2>
        <p>With an ever growing demand for whisky from outside the Scottish borders,
          unauthorised distillation was ubiquitous by the 1820s. Nearly half the whisky
          drunk in Scotland came from illicit stills, with no payment of duty, even
          though Excise Gaugers seized up to 14,000 illicit stills every year.</p>
        <p>The Highland magistrates, themselves members of the landowning classes,
          had a lenient attitude to unlicensed distillers - all of whom would be tenants
          in the local area. They understood that the trade supported the rents paid.
          Imprisoned tenants would not be able to pay any rent. In 1823, Parliament eased
          restrictions on licensed distilleries with the "Excise Act", while at the same
          time making it harder for the illegal stills to operate. Magistrates found
          counsel for the crown appearing in their courts, so forcing the maximum penalties
          to be applied, with some cases removed to the Court of Exchequer in Edinburgh
          for tougher sentences. Highland landowners were now happy to remove tenants
          who were distillers in clearances on their estates. These changes ushered
          in the modern era of Scotch production: in 1823 2,232,000 gallons of whisky
          had duty paid on it; in 1824 this increased to 4,350,000 gallons.</p>
        <p>Two events helped to increase whisky's popularity: first, the introduction
          in 1831 of the column still; the whisky produced with this process was generally
          less expensive to produce and also less intense and smoother, because a column
          still can perform the equivalent of multiple distillation steps in a continuous
          distillation process. Second, the phylloxera bug destroyed wine and cognac
          production in France in 1880.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Perhaps one of the most significant developments in the history of Scotch Whisky
          was the use of oak casks for maturation. During the 1700s and 1800s, whisky was
          most likely drunk unmatured; however, oak wine, sherry and port casks were the
          most appropriate vessels available to store and transfer whisky at that time.
          It was soon recognized that long-term storage in oak casks greatly improved
          the color, aroma and taste of whisky and removed many of the harsher characteristics
          of the unmatured spirit. It eventually became a requirement in the 1900s that
          all whisky be matured in oak casks for a minimum of three years. Today it is
          recognised that the wooden cask in which a whisky is matured is perhaps the single
          most important factor in creating its flavor.</p>
