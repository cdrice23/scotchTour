        <p>As an avid enthusiast of whisky, I (like many others) found myself overwhelmed
          by the vast history and culture surrounding one of my favorite types: Scotch whisky.</p>
        <p>The aim of this blog is for me to practice my HTML/CSS skills as well as provide
          a vehicle for myself and others to learn more about Scotch. Join me on my journey!</p>
