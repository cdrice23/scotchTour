          <h2>Malt Whisky Process</h2>
          <p>The Pot Still process by which Malt Whisky is made is a batch process that
            may be divided into four main stages: Malting, Mashing, Fermentation and Distillation.</p>
          </div>
        <div class="mk_malt_ss">
          <h3>Malting</h3>
          <img src="resources/images/malt.jpg">
          <p>The barley is first screened to remove any foreign matter and then soaked
            for two or three days in tanks of water known as steeps. After this it is
            spread out on a concrete floor known as the malting floor and allowed to
            germinate. Germination may take from 8 to 12 days depending on the season
            of the year, the quality of the barley used and other factors. During
            germination the barley secretes the enzyme diastase which makes the starch
            in the barley soluble, thus preparing it for conversion into sugar. Throughout
            this period the barley must be turned at regular intervals to control the
            temperature and rate of germination.</p>
          <p>At the appropriate moment germination is stopped by drying the malted
            barley or green malt in the malt kiln. More usually nowadays malting is
            carried out in Saladin boxes or in drum maltings. in both of which the process
            is controlled mechanically. Instead of germinating on the distillery floor,
            the grain is contained in large rectangular boxes (Saladin) or in large
            cylindrical drums. Temperature is controlled by blowing air at selected
            temperatures upwards through the germinating grain, which is turned
            mechanically. A recent development caused by the rapid expansion of the
            Scotch Whisky Industry is for distilleries to obtain their malt from
            centralized maltings which supply a number of distilleries, thereby
            enabling the malting process to be carried out more economically.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mk_malt_ss">
          <h3>Mashing</h3>
          <img src="resources/images/mash.jpg">
          <p>The dried malt is ground in a mill and the grist, as it is now called.
            is mixed with hot water in a large circular vessel called a mash tun.
            The soluble starch is thus converted into a sugary liquid known as wort.
            This is drawn off from the mash tun and the solids remaining are removed
            for use as cattle food.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mk_malt_ss">
          <h3>Fermentation</h3>
          <img src="resources/images/ferment.jpg">
          <p>After cooling, the wort is passed into large vessels holding anything
            from 9,000 to 45,000 litres of liquid where it is fermented by the addition
            of yeast. The living yeast attacks the sugar in the wort and converts it into
            crude alcohol. Fermentation takes about 48 hours and produces a liquid known as
            wash, containing alcohol of low strength, some unfermentable matter and certain
            by-products of fermentation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mk_malt_ss">
          <h3>Distillation</h3>
          <img src="resources/images/distill.jpg">
          <p>Malt Whisky is distilled twice in large copper Pot Stills. The liquid wash
            is heated to a point at which the alcohol becomes vapor. This rises up the
            still and is passed into the cooling plant where it is condensed into liquid
            state. The cooling plant may take the form of a coiled copper tube or worm
            that is kept in continuously running cold water, or it may be another type
            of condenser.</p>
          <p>The first distillation separates the alcohol from the fermented liquid and
            eliminates the residue of the yeast and unfermentable matter. This distillate,
            known as low wines, is then passed into another still where it is distilled
            a second time. The first runnings from this second distillation are not
            considered potable and it is only when the spirit reaches an acceptable
            standard that it is collected in the Spirit Receiver. Again, towards the
            end of the distillation. the spirit begins to fall off in strength and
            quality. It is then no longer collected as spirit but drawn off and kept,
            together with the first running, for redistillation with the next low wines.</p>

      <!--Grain Whisky Production-->
      <section>
        <h2>Grain Whisky Process</h2>
        <p>The Patent Still process by which Grain Whisky is made is continuous
          in operation and differs from the Pot Still process in a few ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The mash consists of a proportion of malted barley together with unmalted cereals.</li>
            <li>Any unmalted cereals used are cooked under steam pressure in Converters for
              about 3.5 hours. During this time the mixture of grain and water is agitated by
              stirrers inside the cooker.</li>
            <li>The starch cells in the grain burst and when this liquid is transferred
              to the mash tun, with the malted barley, the diastase in the latter
              converts the starch into sugar.</li>
            <li>The wort is collected at a specific gravity lower than in the case of the Pot Still process.</li>
            <li>Distillation is carried out in a Patent or Coffey Still and the spirit collected
              at a much higher strength</li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <!--Maturation-->
      <section>
        <h2>Maturation</h2>
        <img src="resources/images/scotch_barrels_2.jpg" alt="A row of oak barrels in an underground cellar."
        title="A row of oak barrels in an underground cellar">
        <p>Both Malt and Grain Whisky must be matured after distillation has been completed.
          The new spirit is filled into casks of oak wood which, being permeable, allows air
          to pass in and evaporation takes place. By this means the harsher constituents in
          the new spirit are removed and it becomes in due course a mellow whisky. Malt
          Whisky which contains more of these flavory constituents takes longer to mature
          than Grain Whisky and is often left in the cask for 15 years or even longer.
          The period of maturation for both Malt and Grain Whisky is also affected by the
          size of casks used. the strength at which the spirit is stored and the temperature
          and humidity of the warehouse.</p>
      </section>
      <!--Blending-->
      <section>
        <h2>Blending</h2>
        <p>After maturation the different whiskies may be blended together with other whiskies
          (see <a href="types.html">Types of Scotch Whisky</a> for more detail on the difference
          between single-malt/grain whiskies and blended whiskies).The blend is then reduced
          to the strength required by the addition of soft water. The different whiskies in
          the blend will have derived some color from the casks in which they have been
          matured, but the degree of color will vary from one whisky to another. Whisky
          matured in former fresh oak sherry casks will usually be a darker color than that
          which has been matured in refilled whisky casks. The blender aims at uniformity in
          his product and he may bring his whisky to a definite standard color by adding, if
          necessary, a small amount of coloring solution prepared from caramelized sugar, which
          is infinitesimal in relation to the volume of whisky involved. The whisky is then
          filtered carefully.</p>

      <!--Packaging and Labelling-->
      <section>
        <h2>Packaging and Labelling</h2>
        <img src="resources/images/talisker_10_year.jpg" alt="A bottle of Talisker 10 Year Scotch
        whisky with a close up of the label near the bottle." title="Talisker 10 Year Scotch">
        <p>The final stage in production of Scotch Whisky is labelling and packaging. Most
          Scotch Whiskies are marketed at home and abroad in branded bottles. A Scotch whisky
          label comprises several elements that indicate aspects of production, age, bottling,
          and ownership. Some of these elements are regulated by the <abbr title="Scotch Whisky Regulations">SWR</abbr>,
          and some reflect tradition and marketing.</p>
        <p>The label always features a declaration of the malt or grain whiskies used. A single
          malt Scotch whisky is one that is entirely produced from malt in one distillery. One
          may also encounter the term "single cask", signifying the bottling comes entirely
          from one cask. The term "blended malt" signifies that single malt whisky from different
          distilleries are blended in the bottle. The Cardhu distillery also began using the term
          "pure malt" for the same purpose, causing a controversy in the process over clarity in
          labelling – the Glenfiddich distillery was using the term to describe some single malt
          bottlings. As a result, the Scotch Whisky Association declared that a mixture of single
          malt whiskies must be labelled a "blended malt". The use of the former terms
          "vatted malt" and "pure malt" is prohibited. The term "blended malt" is still debated,
          as some bottlers maintain that consumers confuse the term with "blended Scotch whisky",
          which contains some proportion of grain whisky.</p>
        <p>The brand name featured on the label is usually the same as the distillery name (for example,
          the Talisker Distillery labels its whiskies with the Talisker name).In addition to requiring
          that Scotch whisky be distilled in Scotland, the SWR require that it also be bottled and labelled
          in Scotland. Labels may also indicate the region of the distillery (for example, Islay or Speyside).</p>
        <p>Alcoholic strength is expressed on the label with "Alcohol By Volume" ("ABV") or sometimes simply
          "Vol". Typically, bottled whisky is between 40% and 46% ABV.  Whisky is considerably stronger when
          first emerging from the cask—normally 60–63% ABV. Water is then added to create the desired bottling
          strength. If the whisky is not diluted before bottling, it can be labelled as cask strength.</p>
        <p>A whisky's age may be listed on the bottle providing a guarantee of the youngest whisky used.
          An age statement on the bottle, in the form of a number, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky
          used to produce that product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed age whisky. Scotch
          whisky without an age statement may, by law, be as young as three years old.[1] In the early 21st century,
          such "No age statement" whiskies became more common, as distilleries responded to the depletion of aged
          stocks caused by improved sales. A label may carry a distillation date or a bottling date. Whisky does not
          mature once bottled, so if no age statement is provided, one may calculate the age of
          the whisky if both the distillation date and bottling date are given.</p>
        <p>Labels may also carry various declarations of filtration techniques or final maturation
          processes. A Scotch whisky labelled as "natural" or "non-chill-filtered" has not been
          through a filtration process during bottling that removes compounds that some consumers
          see as desirable. Whisky is aged in various types of casks—and often in used sherry or
          port casks—during distinct portions of the maturation process, and will take on characteristics,
          flavor and aromas from such casks. Special casks are sometimes used at the end of the maturation
          process, and such whiskies may be labelled as "wood finished", "sherry/port finished", and so on.</p>
