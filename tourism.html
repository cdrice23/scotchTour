    <!--Planning a Whisky Tour-->
    <h2>Planning a Whisky Tour</h2>
    <p>Scotch whisky enthusiasts that are hoping to see many of Scotland's finest
      distilleries firsthand should understand some of the intracacies of tour planning.
      Generall, there are two types of tours: <b>distillery tours</b> and <b>tasting tours</b>.</p>

    <p><b>Distillery tours</b> take people through the process of the distillery, and is
      generally more educational for those interested in how whisky is made. Distillery tours
      typically last about an hour and feature a brief tasting during or at the end of the tour.</p>
    <p>Tasting tours</b>, on the other hand, are more focused on the different products
      produced by the distillery and last 2-3 hours. Tasting tours are generally more geared towards
      experienced whisky drinkers that care more on trying the variety of whiskies offered by the distillery,
      and generally do not focus on the distillation process at all.</p>
    <p>Most Scotch distilleries have set times and days in which they offer tours to the
      public, which vary based on the time of year. Peak season (April through September) will
      likely have more tour times, whereas off season (October through March) tours are either less
      frequent or unavailable (depending on the distillery). The Scotch Whisky Association provides
      <a href="http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/news-publications/publications/documents/distilleries-to-visit-2017/#.W4q6fpMzpQJ" target="_blank">
      a helpful guide</a> to each of the major distillery tours including available season, dates and times, and cost.
      Websites like <a href="https://flaviar.com/distilleries/scotch" target="_blank">Flaviar</a> also provide
      interactive maps to help plan distillery tours in advance.</p>

    <p>In all instances of booking Scotch whisky tours, people should <b>always have a disgnated driver to transport
      between distilleries</b>. For larger groups, going through a bulk distillery tour service like
      <a href="http://www.scottishroutes.com/tours/" target="_blank">Scottish Routes</a> offers more
      structure and hassle-free transportation. On the other hand, some people may aim for using public transportation
      or backpacking to various distilleries, which is an experience on its own but limits the amount of
      distilleries to visit in a given amount of time.</a>
