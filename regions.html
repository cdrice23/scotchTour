        <h2>Region Division History</h2>
        <p>Scotland was traditionally divided into four regions: The Highlands, The Lowlands,
          The Isle of Islay, and Campbeltown. Due to the large number of distilleries
          found there, the Speyside region is now also recognized by the Scotch Whisky
          Association (SWA) as a distinct region. The whisky-producing islands other
          than Islay are not recognised as a distinct region by the SWA,
          which groups them into the Highlands region.</p>
        <p>Although only five regions are specifically described, any Scottish locale
          may be used to describe a whisky if it is distilled entirely within that place;
          for example a single malt whisky distilled on Orkney could be described as Orkney
          Single Malt Scotch Whisky instead of as an Island whisky.</p>

          <h3>Highland</h3>
          <p>The Highlands is the largest of the whisky producing regions in Scotland
            and generally produces more full-bodies whiskies with deeper notes of peat
            and smoke.  Due to the vastness of the region, Highland whiskies often taste
            very different from each other, from the extreme heathery, spicy character
            of Northern Highlands to the fruity whiskies of the Southern Highlands.<p>
          <p>Famous Distilleries: Oban, Glenmorangie, Dalmore</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Speyside</h3>
          <p>Speyside, the undisputed center for whisky in Scotland, boasts the highest
            concentration of distilleries (more than half the distilleries in Scotland
            are located in Speyside).  Although the Speyside region is geographically
            part of the Highlands, it is considered a separate region because of its
            unique characteristics.  The region received its name from the river Spey,
            which cuts through the area.  Many of the distilleries use water straight
            from the river Spey in their production process.  Speyside scotch are
            thought to be the country's most complex, and is known for their sweetness
            and elegant flavors and aromas.</p>
          <p>Famous distilleries: Glenlivet, Glenfiddich, Macallan, Johnnie Walker, Chivas Regal</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Lowland</h3>
          <p>There are only three operating distilleries remaining in the Lowlands.  The Lowlands
            is located at the southernmost part of Scotland, and is a flat region with no
            mountains.  Scotch from this region are generally considered as the most
            light bodied of the Single Malts.</p>
          <p>Famous distilleries: Glenkinchie, Bladnoch, Auchentoshan</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Islay</h3>
          <p>Pronunced "<i>eye-luh</i>", Islay scotch is considered to be the smokiest and
            strongest-flavored (some say it tastes of the sea) of the single malts.
            Their strong flavor is believed to be due to the region's exposure to the
            high winds and seas of the west coast.</p>
          <p>Famous distilleries: Laphroaig, Lagavulin, Bowmore, Ardbeg</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Campbeltown</h3>
          <p>Once the whisky capital of Scotland, there are only three distilleries
            remaining in Campbeltown.  The Scotch here is peaty, and has a salty
            hint and a briny character. </p>
          <p>Famous distilleries: Glen Scotia, Glengyle, Springbank </p>
